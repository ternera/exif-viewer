# EXIF Metadata Viewer
Ever wondered about the story behind a photo you see online? The EXIF Metadata Viewer extension lets you instantly reveal the hidden details embedded within images, directly from the context menu in your browser.

All you need to do is right-click on an image to find out if the image has the following details stored:

- Camera settings: Find the make and model of the camera used, along with settings like aperture, shutter speed, and ISO
- Location data: See where the photo was taken (if GPS data is available)
- Date and time: Know exactly when the image was captured.
- And much more: Discover other valuable metadata, such as software used, artist information, and more

It's easy to use: Simply right-click on any image and select "View EXIF Data."
We respect your privacy and don't collect any personal data.
